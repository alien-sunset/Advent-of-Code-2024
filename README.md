hello!<br>
I am not a very good coder, I know very little and what I do know is rather scattershot.
thought this might be fun to stretch myself and hopefully learn something!


day 1:<br>
[https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)<br>
all in LibreOffice calc, because why not? Part one was easy, but I needed a hint about the existance of COUNTIF to get part two. day one file is the saved macro.
(was also given some good coaching about some hertofore unknow functions in JavaScript so I may try doing day one in that as well at some point, but not today)


day2:<br>
[https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)<br>
started in calc again, and it took me a while to figure it out but eventually got it.
I feel like this relies too much on sorting the arrays by length, and then having to adjust the filters to compensate.
while it got it done I feel like there should be a more efficient way to do it, but i just don't know how to apply the filters and make it ignore empty cells. this is one where I think it may actually would have been easier to switch to JS but I still am not familiar enough with all the available functions to do it there either.<br>
at the moment I can't figure out how to properly do part 2. once again I think it would probably work much better in JS so Iâ€™m going to go back to reading up on the types of functions and maths that are available.<br>
(or that there really is some much more efficient way to do the filtering in calc and I just am not aware of it, and using that would make the second part easier as well. I may also poke around in the docs there to see if I can find anything.)
