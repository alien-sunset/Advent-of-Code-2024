hello!<br>
I am not a very good coder, I know very little and what I do know is rather scattershot.
thought this might be fun to stretch myself and hopefully learn something!


day 1:<br>
[https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)<br>
all in LibreOffice calc, because why not? Part one was easy, but I needed a hint about the existance of COUNTIF to get part two. day one file is the saved macro.
(was also given some good coaching about some hertofore unknow functions in JavaScript so I may try doing day one in that as well at some point, but not today)
