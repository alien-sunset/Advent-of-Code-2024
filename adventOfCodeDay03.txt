this is my first time really playing with regex, I’ve heard of it before and recognized the notepad++ (my txt editor of choice) had a field for it in it's find function., but beyond that hadn't really poked it much.  I’m very proud of myself for recognizing that it was probably what I was going to need for this challenge. 

but Boy Howdy was reading up on it both fascinating and confusing! 
I’m def going to spend some more time with the docs because i didn't go very much further than what i needed here, but I’d like to at least skim through and familiarize myself a little better for future endeavors.

so, what I finally came up with was: 


part one:
copy past the input into notepad ++

find: mul\(.{1,3},.{1,3}\) mark all, copy marked. then paste into calc. do math there


part two took some extra fiddling, that final un-canceled "don't" caught me up, and I think there must be a better way to phrase the regex to get it all in one pass, but my brain was turning to mush by then:


\r  replace ""
\n replace ""
don't\(\).+?do\(\)  replace ""
don't\(\).+   replace ""


mul\(.{1,3},.{1,3}\) mark all, copy marked. then paste into calc. do math there

Tah dah.



this was DEF more manual back and forth than necessary and a very good place to try to figure out how to plug all of this into a JS code or something to run all the bits automatically, but i don't know enough of that atm to even have an inkling of how to put it all together and I have decided that I just do not have enough time or energy in a day to take as long as I would need to research and learn it all, but i think these are all going to be re-visited at a later date when I do have the time to do it all more slowly and take to time to properly digest it.
